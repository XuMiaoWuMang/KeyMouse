      `keymouse-flow` v1：录制产物与手写/编辑的载体。它刻意不是第二套执行语义——每一步都会编译成一条人类会敲的命令，因此选择器、焦点闸门、退出码与 `--dry-run` / `--report` / `--retry` 全部与手打命令一致；只有 sleep / wait-window 这类没有命令行等价物的步骤由执行器自己处理。

      `keymouse-flow` v1: what recording writes and what a human edits. Deliberately not a second execution semantic - every step compiles into a command a human would type, so selectors, the focus gate, exit codes and `--dry-run` / `--report` / `--retry` mean the same thing as when typed by hand; only steps without a command-line equivalent (sleep, wait-window) are handled by the runner itself.
